# unix-shell-CLI
This project involved building a simplified Unix shell named wish, designed to mimic the behavior of standard shells like bash. The shell interprets user commands in both interactive and batch modes, manages process creation and execution, and supports key features such as built-in commands, output redirection, and parallel execution.
